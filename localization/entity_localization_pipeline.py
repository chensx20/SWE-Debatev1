ENTITY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a code analysis expert. Given an issue description, your task is to identify the most relevant code entities (classes, methods, functions, variables) that are likely involved in the issue.

⚠️ Important: Only extract entities that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by the issue description. Do not invent names that are not referenced in the text.

**Issue Description:**
{issue_description}

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the issue description to identify:
   - **Classes**: e.g., `UserAuthenticator`, `PaymentProcessor`
   - **Methods/Functions**: e.g., `validate_credentials()`, `process_payment()`
   - **Variables/Parameters**: e.g., `user_id`, `transaction_amount`
   - **Error Types/Exceptions**: e.g., `RateLimitExceededError`, `DatabaseConnectionError`
2. **Focus on direct mentions**: Only include entities that are clearly referenced in the issue.
3. **Avoid redundancy**: If multiple terms refer to the same entity (e.g., "the payment handler" and `PaymentProcessor`), pick the most precise name.
4. **Prioritize key components**: Rank entities by how central they are to the issue.
5. **Return only names**: Do not include paths, modules, or extra descriptions.
6. **Limit to {max_entities} entities**: Select only the {max_entities} most relevant and important entities for this issue.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of exactly {max_entities} entity names in order of relevance (most relevant first):
["entity_name1", "entity_name2", "entity_name3", ...]

**Examples:**

1. **Issue Description:**
    Query syntax error with condition and distinct combination
    Description:
    A Count annotation containing both a Case condition and a distinct=True param produces a query error on Django 2.2 (whatever the db backend). A space is missing at least (... COUNT(DISTINCTCASE WHEN ...).

   **Output (if max_entities=3):**
   ["Count", "DISTINCTCASE", "distinct"]

2. **Issue Description:**
   "After upgrading to v2.0, the `UserSession` class sometimes fails to store session data in Redis, causing login loops."

   **Output (if max_entities=2):**
   ["UserSession", "Redis"]

3. **Issue Description:**
   "The `calculate_discount()` function applies incorrect discounts for bulk orders when `customer_type = 'wholesale'`."

   **Output (if max_entities=3):**
   ["calculate_discount", "customer_type", "wholesale"]

Note: Return only the simple names like "__iter__", "page_range", "MyClass", "my_function", etc. Do not include file paths or full qualified names.
Return exactly {max_entities} entities, prioritizing the most important ones if there are more candidates.

Based on the following code snippets and problem statement, identify the 4 most relevant entities (files, classes, or functions) that are likely involved in solving this issue.

**Problem Statement:**
{problem_statement}

**Code Snippets:**
{code_snippets}

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the problem statement to understand what needs to be fixed/implemented
2. Review the code snippets to identify relevant entities
3. **PRIORITIZE DIVERSITY**: Select entities from different files whenever possible to ensure comprehensive coverage
4. **BALANCE RELEVANCE AND DIVERSITY**: Choose entities that are both highly relevant to the issue AND come from different modules/files
5. Avoid selecting multiple entities from the same file unless absolutely necessary
6. Select exactly 4 entities that collectively provide the best coverage for solving the issue
7. For each entity, provide the exact entity ID in the format expected by the codebase

**Selection Strategy:**
- First priority: High relevance to the problem + Different file locations
- Second priority: High relevance to the problem (even if some files overlap)
- Ensure the selected entities represent different aspects or layers of the solution

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list containing exactly 4 entities, each with the following format:
```json
[

        "diversity_value": "How this entity adds diversity (e.g., 'different file', 'different layer', 'different functionality')"
    }}
]
```

**Example:**
```json

        "entity_id": "src/models.py:UserModel",
        "entity_type": "class",
        "relevance_reason": "Contains user-related functionality mentioned in the issue",

**Available Localization Chains:**
{chains_info}

**Your Task:**
Analyze each localization chain as a potential modification target and vote for the ONE chain where making changes would most likely resolve the issue described above.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Problem Location Accuracy**: Does this chain contain the actual location where the bug/issue manifests?
2. **Modification Impact**: How directly would changes to this code path affect the described problem?
3. **Code Modifiability**: Is the code in this chain well-structured and safe to modify?
4. **Solution Completeness**: Would fixing this chain likely resolve the entire issue, not just symptoms?
5. **Risk Assessment**: What are the risks of modifying this particular code path?

**Key Questions to Consider:**
- Which chain contains the root cause rather than just related functionality?
- Where would a developer most likely need to make changes to fix this specific issue?
- Which code path, when modified, would have the most direct impact on resolving the problem?
- Which chain provides the clearest entry point for implementing a fix?

**Instructions:**
1. For each chain, analyze whether modifying its code would directly address the issue
2. Consider the logical flow: which chain is most likely to contain the problematic code?
3. Evaluate implementation feasibility: which chain would be safest and most effective to modify?
4. Vote for exactly ONE chain that represents the best modification target
